Task 

Intelligent Urban Mobility Analytics & GenAI Insights Platform 

Shape 

Goal 

Build an end-to-end analytics and GenAI system on real-world urban transportation data that performs scalable data cleaning, KPI computation, SQL analytics, PySpark ETL, GenAI-powered insights, and cloud-based API deployment. 

 

Problem Statement 

City planners and transportation companies need scalable insights into trip demand, congestion, revenue patterns, and rider behavior. This project converts raw trip data into actionable KPIs and conversational intelligence. 

 

Tech Stack 

Python, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, PySpark, Matplotlib/Seaborn, OpenAI/Gemini API, LangChain, AWS/Azure (Serverless) 

 

Dataset (Open Source, Large Scale) 

Primary Dataset (Recommended) 

Kaggle – NYC Taxi Trips 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elemento/nyc-yellow-taxi-trip-data 

 

End-to-End Task Breakdown: 

1. Data Ingestion & Cleaning (Python + OOP) 

Objective: Prepare raw trip data for analytics. 

Tasks 

Load raw taxi trip CSVs 

Handle: 

Missing passenger counts 

Zero or negative trip distances 

Invalid timestamps 

Convert: 

Pickup & dropoff times → datetime 

Fare, tip, total amount → numeric 

Feature engineering: 

Hour of day 

Day of week 

Month, Quarter 

Apply OOP: 

MobilityDataAnalyzer class: 

load_data() 

clean_data() 

feature_engineering() 

export_clean_data() 

 

2. KPI Computation & Exploratory Analysis 

Core KPIs 

Total & Monthly Trip Revenue 

Average Trip Distance 

Average Fare per Trip 

Tip Percentage 

Trips per Hour (Demand Pattern) 

Revenue per Mile 

Peak vs Off-Peak Utilization 

Visualizations 

Monthly revenue trends 

Hourly demand heatmap 

Fare & distance outliers 

Tip distribution by time of day 

 

3. Analytical SQL Layer (NO Schema Design) 

Objective: Business-focused SQL analytics. 

Tasks 

Load cleaned data into SQLite / PostgreSQL 

Write analytical SQL queries: 

Peak demand hours using GROUP BY 

Revenue by pickup zone 

Top 10 highest-revenue days 

Average fare by weekday 

Monthly growth using window functions 

Export query results for reporting 

 

4. Scalable ETL with PySpark 

Objective: Handle large-scale trip data efficiently. 

Tasks 

Read multiple months of taxi data using Spark 

Clean and transform data at scale 

Compute KPIs: 

Monthly revenue 

Demand by zone 

Peak-hour congestion indicators 

High-value trip segments 

Write outputs to Parquet 

Capture Spark DAG and explain performance benefits 

 

5. GenAI Urban Mobility Insights Assistant 

Objective: Enable natural-language analytics for decision-makers. 

Capabilities 

Ask questions like: 

“What were the busiest pickup zones last month?” 

“When is surge demand highest?” 

“Why did revenue drop in February?” 

Generate: 

Monthly executive summaries 

Trend explanations 

Tech 

OpenAI / Gemini API 

LangChain for prompt orchestration 

Prompt templates for consistent KPI reasoning 

 
Scalability Strategy (100GB+) 

Storage: S3 / ADLS (Parquet) 

Processing: Spark / Databricks 

Indexing: Vector DB (FAISS / Pinecone) 

Retrieval: RAG over aggregated mobility metrics 

 

6. Cloud Deployment: Serverless Mobility Analytics API (Optional) 

Objective: Expose analytics via cloud APIs. 

Tasks 

Store aggregated KPIs in S3 / Azure Blob 

Deploy: 

AWS Lambda or Azure Function 

API Endpoints: 

/monthly-revenue 

/peak-hours 

/top-zones 

Scheduled execution (daily/monthly) 

Enable logging & monitoring
